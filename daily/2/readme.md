#### Work: 1D Array Lab
_GOAL:_

Gain working familiarity with one-dimensional arrays in Java, or augment prior knowledge.
- Grow cohort KB ("knowledge base") on slack:
- Have a Q? Ask.
- Confident in your skills/knowledge? _See how well you can explain it._

_YOUR CODING MISSION:_

Use the provided skeleton to put your array knowledge into practice. (Copy the starter code from this directory and into your repl.it (you will have to make the 2 folder if you haven't done so already). Additional instrtuctions can be found in the skeleton file.

- SUGGESTED WORKFLOW:
  - Designate "slacker" to interact with slack. (esp. #java-fu and #replit-fu for now...)
  - Designate "driver" to screenshare and type. Multiplayer mode also fine.
  - All parties dialogue as you compose code. (Feel free to use repl.it's multi-player feature (the invite button) but if you do make sure everyone you work with copies all the code to their own repo.)
  - Think about who you will designate as presenter, should you demo to entire cohort.
  - Sync your solution to GitHub when finished.

- PROTIPs:
  - Never stray far from _runnable code_.
  - Comments galore!!!
  - Anytime you are working from a skeleton, keep a copy of the original in a subdir like `skel`. This way you will always have the skeleton on hand for reference if you need it...

  
- DELIVERABLE:
  - Save in your_work_repo: `programming/2/ArrayPractice.java`
  - List all collaborators and consultants in your source code file. 
  - Include heading at top of file, as comment. _E.g.,_
      ```java
      /**
       * 1D Array Practice by Team CodersRUs
       * First Last
       * collaborators: First Last, First Last
       */
      ```
  - Add a comment above each function to tell us who you worked with, or if you got assistance, who from.

#### Competency Grading Matrix

# Concepts
- Assignments
- conditionals
- loops 
- Writing methods
- arrays (1D)
- arrays (2D)
- Introductory recursion 
- Creating and using classes
  - private instance variables
  - constructors
  - Methods with basic types and object types


*Note:* Grade level in the table refers to the grade level exhibited
by completing the specific assignment, so, for instance if you
finished Nim, you would be assured a B type grade which could be a B,
B- or B+ on loops for completing Nim.  However, if you complete another assignment that awards a higher grade for loops, then the higher grade will replace the grade awarded by Nim. Also note that for Arrays2D, the grades earned are more specific, with + and - specified.

Grading: 

*Note: The class portion is subject to adjustment as we finalize the assignments. 

To earn a particular grade, your assignment must compile and run correctly and follow the specification. 

To earn a given overall grade, you need that grade on both the Array
portion and Class portion of the class. So for an A you to complete
the Game of Life and the intermediate SuperArray assignment (this
might be simplified if we run short of time).


# Note: 

Prework submission is required to earn an A/A- grade. The submitted
prework does not have to be 100% complete if the required concepts are
exhibited in the class assignments but at if no prework was submitted
then an A/A- grade will not have been earned.

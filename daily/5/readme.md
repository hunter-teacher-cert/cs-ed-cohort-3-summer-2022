# Time class assignment 

For this project you'll be completing and testing a class that represents time.

Time can be represented in a class in one of two ways:
1. Using three variables, one for hours, one for minutes.
or
2. Using a single variable  for the time in seconds.

The first methods is easier for things like printing or setting a
specific number of minutes.

The second method is easier for comparing times.

You can use either representation for your project.

## Starter files and file locations.

This folder has two starter files:
- Time.java (where you'll write your class)
- Driver.java - the Driver file from which you'll test it

Copy these files into your rep under the /programming/5 folder.


## Specifics

	You will complete your class in Time.java and you will write the code to test it in Driver.java. Specific requirements and levels are in the Time.java file.
	
## Compiling and running 

You can compile each file using:
- javac Time.java
- javac Driver.java

or you can compile them both at once using:
- javac Driver.java Time.java

To run your program, first compile both .java files and then run using:
- java Driver

Notice that you only specifiy the Driver on the java line.

/**
   INSTRUCTIONS:

   This file contains the starter code for our Time class.

   The class here uses ints for hours, minutes, and seconds but you
   could decide to change the internal representation to just store
   an int representing a number of seconds.

   Place this file in a folder named programming/5/Time.java

   Basic level (complete all):
   - public Time(int hrs, int mins, int secs) - constructor
   - public String toString()
   - public void set(int hrs, int mins, int secs)

   Intermediate level (complete Basic methods plus this method):
   - public void add(Time other)
   - public boolean equals(Time other)

   
   Advanced level (complete Basic + Intermediate + these two methods):
   - public int compareTo(Time other)

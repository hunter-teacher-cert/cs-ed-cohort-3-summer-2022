Schedule for Day 3

1. Demos and review of ArrayPractice lab
2. Lesson on 2D arrays 
3. Lab - Array2DPractice, specification below
4. Demos on start of Array2DPractice
5. If time, introduction on Conway's Game of Life lab.

Array2DPractice assignment:

Take the starter code from this directory (the file named
ArrayPractice.java) and copy it to your repl.it repl. Place it in the
folder /programming/3 (you will have to make the 3 folder if you
haven't done so already).

Additional instrtuctions can be found in the Array2DPractice.java file.

Notes:

- Work with your breakout room - help each other - make sure you're all progressing together.
- Make sure to sync your solution to GitHub when finished.
- Feel free to use repl.it's multi-player feature (the invite button) but if you do make sure everyone you work with copies all the code to their own repo.
- In your Array2DPractice.java file make sure to credit your partners. Specifically, add a comment above any function to tell us who you worked with, or if you got assistance, who from.
- Read all the methods before you start - earlier ones might be easier for some people but for others, a later problem might be easier to start with.

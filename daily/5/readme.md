# Time class assignment 

For this project you'll be completing and testing a class that represents time.

Time can be represented in a class in one of two ways:
1. Using three variables, one for hours, one for minutes.
or
2. Using a single variable  for the time in seconds.

Design Considerations:
* The first approach is easier for things like printing or setting a specific number of minutes.
* The second approach is easier for comparing times.
* You can use either representation for your project.

## Starter files and file locations

This folder has two starter files:
- Time.java (where you'll write your class)
- Driver.java - the Driver file you will use to test it

Copy these files into your rep under the `/programming/5` folder.


## Specifics

You will complete your class in Time.java and you will write the code to test it in Driver.java. Specific requirements and levels are in the Time.java file.
	
## Compiling and Running 

You can compile each file using
- `javac Time.java`
- `javac Driver.java`

or you can compile them both at once using
- `javac Driver.java Time.java`

To run your program, first compile __both__ .java files, then run using
- `java Driver`

Notice that you only specifiy the Driver on the java line.
